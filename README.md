# fake-news-test

This was a practice project to build a 'fake news' detection algorithim.

It uses TfidfVecotrizer to assess the makeup of the text of an article and then uses a PassiveAggressiveClassifier to build a model on whether the news is fake or real.

Built using the DataFlair guidance and data source (source: https://data-flair.training/blogs/advanced-python-project-detecting-fake-news/), notes in code are mine.
